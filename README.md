### Learning Haxe
Random stuff I wrote to learn the Haxe programming language.

#### Base64EncodeImages
Reads all images in a directory, converts them to base64, and creates a HTML page that contains the
images using the base64 encodings.

##### HelloWorldNeko
Typical "Hello World" program, in Haxe, targeting Neko.

##### SpriteCreator
Reads all images in a directory, combines them into a single sprite image, generates a CSS file that points
to each image inside of the sprite, and creates a HTML file that displays the images using the sprite.
