### Learning Haxe
Random stuff I wrote while learning the Haxe programming language.

#### Base64EncodeImages
Reads all images in a directory, converts them to base64, and creates a HTML page that contains the
images using the base64 encodings.

##### HelloJavascript
Typical "Hello World" program, in Haxe, targeting Javascript.

##### HelloMultiPlatform
Typical "Hello World" program, in Haxe, targeting C#, Java, Javascript, and Neko. Has examples of
using preprocessor instructions for conditional compilation and a macro method to display the name
of the current runtime platform.

##### HelloWeb
Typical "Hello World" web program, in Haxe, targeting Neko.

##### HelloWorldNeko

##### SingleBinaryKnapsack
Various implementations of algorithms that solve the single, binary knapsack problem.

##### SpriteCreator
Reads all images in a directory, combines them into a single sprite image, generates a CSS file that points
to each image inside of the sprite, and creates a HTML file that displays the images using the sprite.
