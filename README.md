### Learning Haxe
Random stuff I am writing to learn the Haxe programming language.

#### Base64EncodeImages
Read all images in a directory, convert them to base64, and create an HTML page that contains the
images using the base64 encodings.

##### HelloWorldNeko
Typical "Hello World" program, in Haxe, targeting Neko.

##### SpriteCreator
Read all images in a directory, combine them into a single image, generate a CSS file that points
to each image, and create an HTML file that displays the images using the sprite.
