Closures appear to be expensive. See the code generated before commit

Switching (using the switch statement) on an enum appears to be expensive.  See the code generated
before commit 1f3206ba08efc9f3d95a0fe6dd75de06db8f8d0a (Apr 25 21:07:13 2014).

There appears to be a bug in C#/Java that is outputted for generic Vectors. (Or at least I noticed
it while using Vectors). Basically, the result is typed as and object array (object[]). Instead of
the actual concrete type. The code compiles and the neko runtime executes successfully, but the C#
and Java versions fail with class cast exceptions.
